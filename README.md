# Local Artist

Local Artist is a platform for connecting local artists, fringe artwork galleries (like coffee shops etc), and art lovers.
For artists, it's a way to display their work and get name recognition.  For places like coffee shops that want 
to beautify their venue, it's a way to easily connect with local artists and create a showing.  For art lovers or people who
are curious to learn more about art, they can learn more about who artists are, what their artwork is, and where they can
see art all around them.
